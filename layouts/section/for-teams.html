                    <h5>Quicker onboarding and fewer bugs</h5>
                    <p class="description uk-text-justify">It can often take a long time for developers to set up their machines when they start a new project (hours
                        or days) and differences between software versions increases the chance of incompatibilities and
                        bugs when code is deployed.</p>
                    <p class="description uk-text-justify">Consistent development environments, using Virtualbox and Docker, remove these problems and ensure everyone
                        is developing against the same software.</p>

                    <h4>Easy, safe deployments</h4>
                    <h5>Release often, and without fear</h5>
                    <p class="description uk-text-justify">A manual deployment process makes it easy for someone to accidentally do something in the wrong order
                        or in a subtly incorrect way.
                    </p>
                    <p class="description uk-text-justify">Automated deployments remove the potential for mistakes â€” each deployment runs exactly as it should.
                        Continuous Integration allows non-developers to deploy code to agreed environments and allows a focus
                        on the test suite.</p>

                        future issues.</p>
