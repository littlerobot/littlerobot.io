With nearly a decade of professional development experience, I have worked in the educational sector with the University of Cambridge, and with many private sector companies, including 118 118.

I love helping businesses and software development teams become more productive.

When developing software, I like to really understand what the business is trying to achieve and work closely with end users so we can develop a solution together that does exactly what they need.
